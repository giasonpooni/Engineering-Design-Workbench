# Development guide

The [proved heat guide](PROVED_HEAT.md) gives the exact Linux build and
`scripts/check_proved_heat.py` acceptance command for SCR/SP1. The native gate
requires a real original proof, fresh proved replay, retained-proof reverification
and corrupted-proof rejection from an installed CIW wheel; skipped tests fail it.
`tests/test_proved_heat.py` separately exercises structural/refusal boundaries
with explicit test doubles. Such tests never count as cryptographic evidence.
The [Julia oscillator guide](JULIA_OSCILLATOR.md) records the bounded worker,
oracle, raw-byte replay and environment gates. The broader [Julia and SP1
contract](JULIA_SP1.md) records the later persistent-worker, F2 checker and
benchmark requirements.

Public documentation describes implemented behavior, executable contracts,
reproducible examples and measured limitations. The [architecture](ARCHITECTURE.md)
identifies current components; [PROTOCOL.md](PROTOCOL.md) specifies exact record
and transport semantics.

## Contribution requirements

- Preserve numerical engines and their independent reference checks. Python
  owns scientific records/calculations; Godot owns rendering and interaction.
- Keep terminal-only operation functional. Disconnecting a viewport must not
  stop the backend service.
- Preserve separate evidence, operation, execution, result and verification
  identities. Displayed geometry, numerical checks and replay equality do not
  confer verification.
- Compute from full-resolution records. Keep missing observations explicit.
- Keep playback cursors separate from half-open analysis intervals; reject
  stale selection revisions and record an operation's actual support.
- Validate saved records without executing numerical providers. Runtime
  bindings are supplied explicitly and never loaded from workspace content.
- The operation runner copies provider runtime identities before execution and
  returned payloads before retention. Reusing or mutating provider-owned objects
  must not alter retained records. Invalid runtime identities refuse before the
  provider executes, retaining a restorable refusal with `runtime: null`.
- Preserve covariance ordering, frames, units, source identities and declared
  assumptions. Do not silently repair, diagonalize or reinterpret a matrix.
- Use isolated branches/checkouts and review current remote changes before
  integration. Never overwrite another contributor's work or force-push shared
  history. Separate documentation and executable changes where practical.

## Repository layout

| `src/ciw/core/` | Record, identity and covariance contracts |
| `src/ciw/adapters/` | Adapter bindings and trusted saved-payload validators, including RCI provenance and covariance dependency checks |
| `src/ciw/operations/` | Operation registry, execution records and schema dispatch |
| `src/ciw/session.py`, `server.py`, `cli.py` | Shared state, transport and terminal commands |
| `src/ciw/covariance_workflow.py`, `investigation.py`, `geodesic.py`, `plsr.py` | Implemented scientific workflows, including covariance execution and replay |
| `src/ciw/calibration_status.py` | Serving-time applicability at an explicit `evaluated_at`, separate from evidence |

`recordings/`, `results/` and `.ciw/` hold local runtime output and are ignored by
Git. Scientific source pins live in the `src/ciw/*-runtimes.json` manifests,
`src/ciw/plsr-runtime.json`, and the explicit `PIN`/`PINS` declarations in native
workflow modules linked by their operating guides. Update pins only with the
relevant compatibility and replay checks. The covariance examples in `examples/adapters/` include
`two-reservoir-covariance.json` and `tank-covariance-map.json`; the original
`two-reservoir.json` fixture remains available.

## CI event routing

Ordinary pull requests run Prototype checks and Workflow contracts, including
documentation-only pull requests. The sixteen native qualification workflows
omit a run only when every changed file matches this narrow documentation list:
`README.md`, `docs/**/*.md`, `deploy/**/*.md`, `godot/**/*.md`, or
`examples/**/README.md`. Files such as scripts or JSON fixtures under `docs/`
still select qualification. A documentation-only update to an existing code PR
uses the complete PR diff and therefore still qualifies that code.

Every other change continues to select every native qualification workflow.
In particular, source, record contracts, provider pins, dependency declarations,
test fixtures, scripts and workflow changes retain broad coverage. Existing job
commands, matrices, timeouts, numerical checks and zero-skip requirements are
unchanged. This is a conservative reduction in redundant work; Prototype checks
still include optional PLSR, Godot and deployment jobs and are not yet a minimal
core-only gate.

Automatic push runs are limited to `main` and all tags, avoiding duplicate
feature-push and PR runs. PR target branches are unrestricted so stacked PRs
remain covered. Branches without a PR can request `workflow_dispatch`; all
migrated workflows support manual runs. Tag and manual runs retain full
qualification regardless of documentation filters. Publish a tag only when
its complete qualification is intended.

Superseded runs cancel only within the same workflow/event/PR. Main, tag and
manual runs use a unique run ID and cannot cancel each other's qualification.

`scripts/check_ci_policy.py` checks the eighteen migrated workflow policies,
with regression cases in `scripts/tests/test_ci_policy.py`. The dev extra pins
`PyYAML==6.0.3`, and the Workflow contracts job installs that extra rather than
a second PyYAML pin. The job also runs checksum-pinned actionlint. A routing
pass only validates CI selection policy; it establishes no numerical, provider,
proof or physical claim.

Before enabling required status checks, account for path-filtered workflows:
GitHub can leave a required check pending when its workflow does not run.
Prototype checks and Workflow contracts have no path filter. At this increment,
main has no required check contexts or repository rulesets; no protection setting
is changed. Future profile-specific selection requires an explicit dependency
map before narrowing this conservative all-code qualification.

## Validation commands

```sh
python -m pip install -e '.[dev]'
python -m pytest -q
python scripts/check_adapters.py
```

The adapter script clones the explicitly pinned current and historical
scientific sources. Source-dependent tests skip when their documented checkout
variables are absent; report those skips. The optional PLSR environment and
installed-package checks are described in [PLSR.md](PLSR.md).

The three [geometry provider profiles](GEOMETRY_RESEARCH.md) have an installed
CIW wheel gate on Python 3.12 with exact clean public provider pins:

```sh
python scripts/check_geometry_research.py --output-dir results/geometry-gate
```

The [variational free-energy bench](VARIATIONAL_FREE_ENERGY.md) has a separate
installed-wheel gate on Python 3.12, Linux and Windows. It provisions exact CSG,
GSIE and PLSR revisions, exercises six retained simulation cases, checks offline
records and fresh replay, and runs the live shared-session client. Every native
test must run without skips:

```sh
python scripts/check_free_energy.py --output-dir results/free-energy-gate
```

This gate requires all native analytical, retained-contract, shared-session and
replay tests to complete without skips, on Linux and Windows. It retains the
three original/replay artifact pairs and a reopenable workspace. Its scope is
mathematical reference behavior and record consistency; independent ICRH
profiles and physical calibration remain separate work.

The installed candidate gate requires Python 3.12, Git, Node.js 22.13 and `npm`
on `PATH`, plus network access for the pinned providers and packages:

```powershell
python -m pip install "setuptools>=77" wheel numpy==2.4.3 websockets==16.0
python scripts/check_workbench_candidates.py
```

The gate resolves the Windows `npm.cmd` executable and passes `core.autocrlf=false`
to its Git commands and nested helpers so pinned source bytes are preserved.
It does not change global Git configuration. Reused checkouts must already match
their pinned bytes; the gate does not repair them. Skipped integration tests
fail this gate. The pinned ESM fixture helper still invokes `npx` without resolving
the Windows command shim, so the complete candidate gate currently runs in Ubuntu
CI; the Windows helper failure is a test-tooling limitation.

For viewport changes run `python scripts/check_godot.py --godot <Godot 4.5.2 executable>`
(import, `godot/tests/protocol_smoke.gd`, `channel_generality.gd`, `adapter_boundary.gd`);
[godot/README.md](../godot/README.md) documents the individual commands. Deployment
changes use the checks in [deploy/README.md](../deploy/README.md). Record unavailable
checks honestly.
Covariance validation includes `tests/test_covariance_artifacts.py` for the
artifact contract, `tests/test_covariance_records.py` for saved dependencies and
cycle refusal, and `tests/test_covariance_integration.py` for the pinned v2 path
and historical replay. `tests/test_calibration_status.py` checks live read
surfaces, `tests/test_rci_records.py` checks retained measurement provenance,
and `tests/test_covariance_replay_refusal.py` checks refusal when no runtime was
bound to the original attempt. Historical replay requires the legacy checkouts.
`tests/test_operation_runner.py::test_provider_owned_outputs_cannot_mutate_retained_records`
checks provider-object isolation for successful and refused executions, and
`test_invalid_runtime_refusal_remains_restorable` checks that invalid runtime
identities prevent execution while preserving save/restore.
The provider-free typed contract foundations are exercised by
`tests/test_machine_manifest.py`, `tests/test_project_model.py` and
`tests/test_thermal_contract.py`; these cover evidence-bound machine binding,
project-history invalidation and independent thermal-reference replay. The
machine and thermal operation lifecycles are covered by
`tests/test_machine_workflow.py` and `tests/test_thermal_workflow.py`, including
save/reopen and fresh replay. Project operation/execution/result registration
remains the next integration gate; see [contract foundations](CONTRACT_FOUNDATIONS.md).
Coverage is not exhaustive: the off-allowlist `runtime_mismatch`,
`RUNTIME_UNAVAILABLE` and `RUNTIME_IO` branches, covariance CLI argument parsing,
and the calibration-refusal exit code lack dedicated assertions in the current
suite. Passing shared helper tests does not separately validate those paths.
[RECONCILIATION.md](RECONCILIATION.md) records, per contract area, the behavior
the current tests assert, what they cover in part, and what is not implemented.

Documentation-only edits require working links and consistency with the
implemented interfaces; they do not imply a new numerical validation result.

The native geodesic-reference gate is `python scripts/check_geodesic_references.py`.
It runs both pinned providers from an installed CIW wheel, exercises the live
session and provider-free restore, rejects skips, then independently checks the
retained pairs with pinned ICRH profiles. See [the operating contract](GEODESIC_REFERENCES.md)
for local-checkout arguments and numerical scope. Existing authenticated local
checkouts can also provision older integration gates; [provider availability](PROVIDER_AVAILABILITY.md)
documents their options and remaining public-source assumptions.

## Documenting an integrated tool

Update the README catalogue and [INSTRUMENTS.md](INSTRUMENTS.md) when a supported
workbench connection changes. Include:

- Purpose, actual integration status and scientific scope.
- Tool/adapter identity, schema versions and a reproducible full source pin.
- Installation, explicit input files and copyable terminal commands.
- Input/output shapes, ordering, units, frames and time conventions.
- Success, refusal and error meanings; retained evidence and runtime provenance.
- A worked end-to-end example, validation commands and relevant tests.
- Implemented views, save/reopen/replay behavior and known limitations.

List a tool as integrated only after its documented workbench path has been
exercised with representative inputs and its output/provenance checked.
Installation or a standalone schema alone does not establish integration.

## Names and deployment namespace

The distribution is `computational-instrumentation-workbench`; the console
command is `ciw`. `compose.yaml` declares no project name, so Compose uses the
checkout directory's name, and builds the image as `ciw-backend:local`; the
container check runs under a temporary `ciw-check-<id>` project. Presentation
names do not change scientific record identities. Changing a Compose project
name changes named-volume prefixes; consult the deployment guide first.
