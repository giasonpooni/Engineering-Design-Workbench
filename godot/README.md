# Optional Godot viewport

Godot **4.5.2**, GDScript, desktop GL Compatibility. Start the Python service in a separate terminal, then open `project.godot` in Godot or run:

```text
godot --path godot
```

The client connects to `ws://127.0.0.1:8765`. The service remains usable if this window closes. No addons, .NET runtime, browser bridge, scientific packages, or imported assets are required in Godot.

The **Experiments** tab is the shared view of retained process, calibrated-window,
telemetry and identified-design bundles. It follows `workbench.changed`, displays
native values and full covariance, links instrument dependencies to retained
results, and marks disconnected data stale. Coordinate, mesh and declared-parameter
panels that include a presentation `render` descriptor are drawn in the declared
plane, as a declared wireframe, or on the retained parameter axis. Mesh-path
views also reuse the oscillator 3D canvas for the declared vertices; the numeric
table remains authoritative. See the [experiment view guide](../docs/EXPERIMENT_VIEW.md)
for provider setup, protocol, scientific boundaries and testing. The existing
oscillator viewport is available in the **Oscillator** tab.

The phase view plots retained position and velocity samples. Click within 20 pixels of a trajectory point to move the shared playback cursor to that retained sample time. The timeline and Play button also update this cursor. Channel and half-open `[start,end)` interval are shared with terminal clients; playback never changes the interval or recomputes analyses. The 3D view displays Python-supplied energy-surface and trajectory meshes using the declared visual transform. Drag to orbit and use the mouse wheel to zoom. All three numeric cards are `sample.get` results, never values reconstructed from displayed geometry.

Selection updates carry the observed revision, coalesce at no more than 10 requests per second, and permit only one outstanding update. Responses are matched by request ID. On a revision conflict the client discards pending selection intent and refreshes authoritative state. Sample requests are also coalesced, and an obsolete response cannot replace the latest requested sample. A fresh snapshot is checked every five seconds; unanswered requests time out after eight seconds. Disconnects retain the last view with a visible STALE indication and disable shared interaction. Use Reconnect after restarting the service.

Checks, run from the repository root:

```text
godot --headless --path godot --editor --import --quit
godot --headless --path godot --script res://tests/protocol_smoke.gd
godot --headless --path godot --script res://tests/channel_generality.gd
```

The channel generality check needs no service: it supplies snapshots directly and asserts that the channel selector, the numeric cards, the selection round-trip and the phase-portrait axes all come from the record rather than from any compiled-in channel list, across records of two, three and five channels.

The protocol smoke needs a running service. It connects two clients, loads the recorded run, changes the cursor in one, observes the broadcast in the other, checks numerical inspection against the retained record, verifies the interval did not change, restores the original cursor, and verifies inspection refresh after reconnect at the same revision. It fails after 15 seconds if the service is unavailable. Do not run it during an interactive session where another user is changing the same selection.

For a repeatable visual capture with a real graphics driver and live service, run `godot --path godot --script res://tests/capture_view.gd -- /absolute/path/view.png`. This opens a render window, saves the synchronized viewport, and exits. Headless rendering does not provide a usable screenshot.

This first viewport implements no acquisition, scientific reconstruction, spectral computation, binary transport, or verification claim. Axis scaling and camera operations affect presentation only.
