"""Every path and line a doc cites must resolve. Checked, not trusted.

Three defects of exactly one shape turned up in one audit: a doc asserting the
suite passed under a kernel seven lines above its own evidence that it did not, a
module docstring naming the proof statuses as the verdict vocabulary it was
written to keep separate, and a docstring claiming portability the code did not
have. Prose drifts from code silently because nothing runs it.

Not everything a doc claims is mechanically checkable. What is: the file it points
at exists, and a `file.py:123` citation is inside that file. Those are the
citations a reader follows to verify the rest, so a broken one costs more than its
size. This test makes them fail at home.

stdlib unittest only.

    verify a claim, so it must exist. A bare *name* is usually a file a demo

    an entry inside an archive (`markup.bcf`), and requiring those to exist would
