# World identity: what a digest names

Two identities, answering different questions.

```text
world_digest      this lowering, here, named this way
portable_digest    this model and this belief, anywhere
```

## The thing to know first

`World.digest()` hashes the IR printer's dump, and the printer emits every
`meta` key — including `source`, which is the path string the caller passed to
`load_ifc`. So one file, byte for byte, has as many world digests as there are
ways to spell its name:

| spelled as | `world_digest` |
|---|---|
| `gat/demo/model.ifc` | `020383e8…` |
| `./gat/demo/model.ifc` | `e7f0d899…` |
| `/home/user/…/gat/demo/model.ifc` | `ae337184…` |
| `gat/demo/../demo/model.ifc` | `c9d15bef…` |

This is not a bug in `world_digest`. It is what `world_digest` is for: checking
that a decision and a model are the *same lowering*, which is exactly the
mismatch `gat view` reports when it says a decision "was evaluated on a
different world than the model … load it with the same path form the headless
request used".

It does mean one thing that matters for the portfolio: **a pinned
`world_digest` is only reproducible from the same checkout, with the same path
spelling.** Two checkouts of this repo at different absolute paths produce
`ae337184…` and `53ef806a…` for the same file.

## What that cost, concretely

`validation/opening-fit-disposition-v1.json` and
`validation/opening-fit-design-review-disposition-v1.json` pin
`world_digest: be62ab70…` and `case_digest: 548200b5…`. No current path form
reproduces those — so the opening-fit replay, which is one of the two
dispositions the kernel freeze protects, has been unverifiable rather than
verified. Re-pinning it is a version bump, not a repair, so it is left as it
stands and recorded here.

A second defect surfaced in the same pair, and it is not about paths. The
design-review pin carries

```json
"policy_id": "design-review-v1",
"disposition": "ACCEPT",
"evidence_receipt_ids": [],
"reasons": ["all checks are satisfied and required evidence is verified"]
```

No evidence was verified, and under `design-review-v1` none was required. The
sentence was produced by a single `else` branch in
`evaluate_acceptance_case` that ran whether or not the policy required
evidence. The branch is now split, so a design-review `ACCEPT` says that the
policy does not require verified as-built evidence, and every outcome carries
`evidence_required_for_accept` — because two `ACCEPT`s can mean different
things and a downstream reader has only the record.

The shipped pins are not regenerated: their re-pin is the same kernel version
bump as the path issue above, and bundling a correctness fix into a frozen
replay silently is the thing the freeze exists to stop.
`tests/test_workflow_acceptance.py::ShippedPinDriftTests` asserts both halves
instead — that the file still carries the stale sentence, and that the runtime
can no longer emit it — so the disagreement is in the suite rather than in
nobody's head. `tests/test_bcf_export.py` reads the design-review pin as an
export fixture (it is the `ACCEPT` that must refuse to produce a BCF topic),
which is a use of its disposition, not of its digests.

## The portable identity

`gat.adapters.portable_identity` adds a second digest and changes no existing
one. Same composition as the kernel's — module digest, then the full-view mean
and covariance — with location meta elided:

```python
from gat.adapters.portable_identity import portable_world_digest, world_identity

portable_world_digest(world)   # same for every spelling of the same file
world_identity(world)          # both digests + the source, for a citation
```

Only `source` is elided. `lowering_scope` is not: a scope is what the world
**is**, not where it came from, so a scoped world keeps a distinct portable
digest. The belief participates too — an `ObserveQuantity` moves the portable
digest, or it would not identify a world at all.

## Which to use

- Same lowering? → `world_digest`. Keep using it, keep pinning it locally.
- Crossing a repo, a machine, or a checkout? → `portable_digest`.

`identity_gap` still compares `world_digest` values, so its
`beam_pin_is_live_ifc` answers a question about path spellings. Moving it to
the portable digest would change `validation/identity-gap-v1.json`, which the
harness reads, so that is a deliberate follow-up rather than a side effect of
adding this.

Nothing here merges worlds. `forced_common_world` stays false; equal names
still do not imply equal worlds, and now a citation can actually say which.
