"""Compose instrument artifacts only where the axioms survive the join.

Three instruments, three typed objects, and the whole content of this module is
the refusal at each arrow:

    declare plant / IFC world
      -> JSPT      A = J(x*)          square, finite, within the certificate law
      -> PLSR      verdict on A        bound to that exact A, from the real vocabulary
      -> CSE       disposition         a certificate is support, never authorization

A script is legal only when the codomain of the previous object is the domain of
the next. A non-square beam Jacobian does not become an ``A``. A verdict on one
matrix does not transfer to another. A certificate does not become ACCEPT. Those
are checked *before* anything runs, and a miss is a refusal with a reason, not an
exception swallowed into the next stage.

What this module deliberately is not:

- It imports no companion runtime. The portfolio rule is "each repo keeps local
  I. none import another runtime", so this reads JSON and checks laws. The
  companion's own constants are mirrored here and a test asserts they agree
  wherever the companion is importable -- the same agreement-not-import pattern
  used for the JSPT ownership pin.
- It computes nothing. No Jacobian, no Lyapunov solve, no device. The linear bulk
  belongs inside one kernel with an oracle match test; a stitcher that also
  computed would be the megascript this is meant to avoid.
- It invents no verdicts. PLSR ships TWO vocabularies and this module refuses to
  let them touch. ``lyapunov.runtime.verdict`` returns a ``Verdict.status`` from
  {certified, violated, outside-level, inconclusive}, lower case, and that is
  the stability claim. ``lyapunov.host_callback.ProofStatus`` is
  {NOT_CHECKED, INVALID, VERIFIED}, upper case, and says only whether a bound
  host checked an SP1 proof's arithmetic. Codes discussed but not shipped are
  refused, because an axiom system whose terms exist only in prose refuses
  nothing.

  This paragraph previously named the proof statuses as "PLSR's shipped
  vocabulary" for verdicts, which is the conflation the constants below were
  written to stop. Running the real companion is what caught it; the docstring
  was not updated with the code it describes.

- **It does not check that the verdict is true of A.** It checks that the
  receipt is bound to this exact A and speaks a real vocabulary. Whether the
  matrix actually decreases is PLSR's claim, made where the solve happened, and
  re-deriving it here would be the computation this module refuses to do. So a
  forged receipt saying ``certified`` for an A with positive eigenvalues
  composes, and should: the axioms constrain the form of a claim, not its truth.
